This program train LSTM model to predict the types of comments. saveModel.pth is the trained model and has the accuracy around 85 percent.

* train.json is the data used in training.

* config.py is used to set up CPU or GPU.

* hw2main.py contains the traning and preiction process.

* student.py constains the process of preprocessing of data, tokenizering the input, initilizing LSTM model and loss function update.
